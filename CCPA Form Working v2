  Why Should You Care?
content: |
  Today, it's a standard practice for businesses to use your personal information for many different purposes. A lot of information about you and your household can be collected with or without your knowledge, which can be used by individual businesses, shared with related companies, and made available to others. Information that is gathered about you is combined and analyzed to create profiles of your preferences, behavior, attitudes, abilities and other characteristics. Exercising your rights to limit the data businesses can use, store, and share  can help protect you from unwanted, unfair, or harmful uses of your personal information.

question: |
  As a California resident, you have the right to:
subquestion: |
  - **Know** the types of personal information a business collects and what it may do with it,       and about Californians’ CCPA rights as well as **see** the specific pieces of personal           information a business has collected about you.
  - **Delete** (some of) the personal information a business has collected about you.
  - **Opt-out of the sale** of your personal information.
  
  Some of the rights the CCPA grants are automatic, while others require you to take steps to     exercise them.

  For example
content: |
  For example, California citizens have the right not to be discriminated against by a business for exercising their CCPA rights. In contrast, California residents must actively notify businesses when they want to know, delete, or opt-out of the sale of their personal     information. The CCPA also allows California residents to sue a business if it fails to implement reasonable security measures when their personal information is compromised in a data breach.
